Assorted Playgrounds in Swift for Practice

* I'm taking a class on Swift from Udemy, and in between building small but functional apps, the teacher is going over the basics of Swift,
things like Variables, Arrays, Loops, etc, and I think it's important to keep track of those lessons, and the little challenges that
he gives the students as well. 

* This repo is simply the collection of challenges and examples the teacher has given of these basics, and my attempt at the challenges.
